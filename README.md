# Large Datasets Embedding and Visualization Project
Welcome to the Large Datasets Embedding and Visualization Project repository! This project focuses on embedding and visualizing large datasets using state-of-the-art manifold learning methods. We've employed advanced techniques such as t-SNE, UMAP, TriMAP, PacMAP, and IVHD. These methods are applied to specially created synthetic datasets for comprehensive analysis and visualization.

## Features
* State-of-the-Art Methods: We utilize cutting-edge manifold learning methods including t-SNE, UMAP, TriMAP, PacMAP, and IVHD to embed high-dimensional datasets into lower-dimensional spaces.
* Synthetic Datasets: Specially created synthetic datasets are used for experimentation and analysis, providing diverse and complex data structures to test the efficacy of the embedding methods.
* Visualization: The project focuses on visualizing the embedded datasets to gain insights into their underlying structures and relationships.
